In Fall 2023, I served as a teaching assistant for CSC 110: Computer Science Principles.

I helped support an introductory cohort of students as they learned foundational computing concepts and Python programming. My responsibilities included:

- Holding weekly office hours to answer questions about programming assignments and course concepts  
- Assisting with grading of homework and projects  
- Monitoring and responding to questions on the course discussion forum  
- Building a small Python tool using the Piazza API to batch-assess discussion posts and streamline participation tracking
