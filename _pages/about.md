I’m an undergraduate in the Department of Computer Science at North Carolina State University. I’m especially interested in quantum computing systems, architectures, and security.

Research
======
In Summer 2025, I was an undergraduate research assistant in the Computer Architecture and Security Lab at Northwestern University. There, I built tooling to evaluate commercial quantum devices using an information-per-dollar metric.

Before that, I completed an independent study in communication complexity at NC State streaming models and sketching algorithms, and implementing them in C.

Teaching
======
I’ve been a teaching assistant for several courses at NC State:

- CSC 110: Computer Science Principles  
- CSC 116: Introduction to Computing (Java)  
- CSC 333: Automata, Grammars, and Computability  

Across these, I’ve run office hours, led problem-solving sessions, graded assignments and exams, and written small tools (like a Piazza API script) to improve feedback and workflow.

 <!-- I enjoy demystifying material for students who are seeing it for the first time, especially when it comes to proofs and theory. -->
