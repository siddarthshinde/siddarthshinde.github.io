This in-progress manuscript studies how to evaluate **accuracy–cost tradeoffs** in practical quantum computing systems and proposes a **fidelity-per-cost–style metric** for comparing different devices and usage models.

The work is based on empirical experiments on cloud quantum hardware and is being developed in collaboration with the Computer Architecture and Security Lab at Northwestern University.
